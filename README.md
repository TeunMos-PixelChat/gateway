# PixelChat Gateway

The PixelChat Gateway is a server that acts as a bridge between the user and the PixelChat API's, the frontend and other services. It is responsible for handling the user's requests and sending them to the appropriate service. Eventually, it will also be responsible for handling the user's authentication and authorization.
